<div class="image-container">

</div>

<p>The department was set up by the late Prof K C Kandhari (HoD,1960-1970) and subsequently headed by late Prof L K Bhutani (1974-1996), Prof J S Pasricha (1996-1998), Prof R K Pandhi (1998-2001) and Prof Vinod K Sharma (2001-2020). Prof Neena Khanna is heading the department since November, 2020.<br> 

Currently the department has 11 faculty members, 25 post-graduate students, 10 senior residents and 3 Ph D scholars.<br>

The department is widely recognised for the quality and innovativeness of its teaching programme for both undergraduate and postgraduates and its contributions to patient care and research. The latter include advances in the diagnosis and treatment of pemphigus, vitiligo (using both medical and surgical techniques and phototherapy), air-borne contact dermatitis, mycetoma, drug reactions, epidermolysis bullosa, ichthyosis-associated rickets and dermatopathology, among others. Faculty members have authored several popular undergraduate and postgraduate textbooks that are used in centres around the world.<br>  

Members of the faculty have served in leadership positions in national and international professional organisations, provided consultations to governmental and non-governmental agencies, organised workshops and conferences, served on the faculty of meetings worldwide and as visiting professors at universities in other countries.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Education</b></h2>
<br>
<p>The Department provides training to MBBS, MD and PhD students. These students are chosen through a centralised selection test conducted by AIIMS.<br> 

Additionally, short term observerships are offered to both national and international trainees in various aspects of the specialty (see https://www.aiims.edu/en/academic_section_training.html for requirements and application details).</p>
<br>
<h2><b>Services</b></h2>
<br>
<p>The Skin OPD is located on the third floor of the new Rajkumari Amrit Kaur OPD and caters to outdoor patients from Monday to Friday from 9:00 AM.
<br>
An appointment is required to visit the department.
<br>
Our department treats adults and children with diseases of the skin, hair and nail, and sexually transmitted infections. We provide medical, surgical, phototherapy, laser and aesthetic services, as appropriate.
<br>
The department also runs specialty clinics in the afternoon for leprosy, photodermatoses, dermato-surgery and aesthetics, pediatric dermatology, vitiligo and other pigmentary diseases, psoriasis and allergic diseases of the skin including urticaria, contact dermatitis and drug allergies. Patients are referred to the afternoon clinics after initial evaluation in the morning OPDs.
